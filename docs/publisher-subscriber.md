# Implementing Pub/Sub Architecture in the Patient Care Management System

Implementing a Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) architecture in the Patient Care Management System can improve scalability and decouple system components. Here's a detailed guide on how to implement it.

---

## Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Choose a Pub/Sub Messaging System

Select a messaging broker that best fits your system requirements. Common options include:

- **Redis**
- **RabbitMQ**
- **Apache Kafka**

### 2. Integrate the Messaging Broker

Install and configure the selected messaging broker in your application environment. Ensure it is optimized for performance and reliability.

### 3. Refactor Components to Use Pub/Sub

Modify the system components to:

- **Publish** messages to specific topics.
- **Subscribe** to relevant topics to receive updates.

### 4. Implement Message Handling Logic

Update system components to process incoming messages appropriately, ensuring seamless integration.

### 5. Test the Pub/Sub System

Thoroughly test the implementation to:

- Verify correct message publication and subscription.
- Check for message delivery reliability and latency.

## What is RTI, and How Can We Benefit from It?

**Real-Time Innovations (RTI)** specializes in real-time messaging solutions, particularly the **Data Distribution Service (DDS)** standard. RTI's **Connext DDS** is a high-performance messaging middleware that offers:

### Benefits:

1. **Low Latency**: Ideal for real-time applications requiring fast data exchange.
2. **Scalability**: Efficiently manages numerous data producers and consumers.
3. **QoS Policies**: Provides fine control over message delivery guarantees and reliability.
4. **Interoperability**: Complies with the DDS standard for seamless integration with other systems.
5. **Enhanced Reliability**: Ensures robust communication even in unreliable networks.

By integrating RTI Connext DDS, the system gains a scalable and reliable Pub/Sub architecture tailored to real-time needs.

## Modifications by File

### 1. `package.json`

- Add the **RTI Connext DDS JavaScript Connector** dependency:

  ```json
  {
    "dependencies": {
      "rti-dds-connector": "^1.x.x"
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. `TicketDispenser.tsx`

- **Publish new tickets** using RTI Connext DDS:

  ```typescript
  const connector = new rti.Connector('MyParticipantLibrary::MyParticipant', 'DDS.xml');
  const output = connector.getOutput('MyPublisher::MyDataWriter');
  output.write({ ticket: newTicketData });
  ```

### 3. `CentralScreen.tsx`

- **Subscribe to ticket updates** via RTI Connext DDS:

  ```typescript
  const connector = new rti.Connector('MyParticipantLibrary::MyParticipant', 'DDS.xml');
  const input = connector.getInput('MySubscriber::MyDataReader');
  input.on('dataAvailable', () => {
    const updates = input.take();
    handleUpdates(updates);
  });
  ```

### 4. `DoctorPage.tsx`

- **Subscribe to tickets** and **publish priority updates**:

  ```typescript
  const input = connector.getInput('MySubscriber::DoctorReader');
  input.on('dataAvailable', () => handleNewTickets(input.take()));

  const output = connector.getOutput('MyPublisher::PriorityWriter');
  output.write({ priorityUpdate: updatedPriority });
  ```

### 5. `PharmacistPage.tsx`

- **Subscribe to priority updates**:

  ```typescript
  const input = connector.getInput('MySubscriber::PriorityReader');
  input.on('dataAvailable', () => processPriorityUpdates(input.take()));
  ```

### 6. `DDS.xml`

- Add the RTI Connext DDS XML configuration:

  ```xml
  <dds>
    <participant_library name="MyParticipantLibrary">
      <domain_participant name="MyParticipant" domainId="0">
        <publisher name="MyPublisher">
          <data_writer topic_ref="TicketTopic" />
        </publisher>
        <subscriber name="MySubscriber">
          <data_reader topic_ref="TicketTopic" />
        </subscriber>
      </domain_participant>
    </participant_library>
  </dds>
  ```

By applying these changes, you can integrate RTI Connext DDS into the Patient Care Management System, enabling a robust Pub/Sub communication mechanism optimized for real-time data exchange.
